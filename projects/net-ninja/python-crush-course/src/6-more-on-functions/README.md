## Functions

We have already seen inbuild functions (len, print, input)

For example, len() gives you the list of items in a container

Very often you want custom functionality, i.e. your own functions!

```py
def func_name(parameters):
    code
    return
```

## Exercise

Create a "shouter" function that takes 2 arguments:

A sting and a number

The funciton hsould print the string multiple times  
(whatever is specified in the number argument)

Capitalise every letter taht is printed

If the number is greater than 10 don't print the input string. Instead, print 'you are too loud' once

The function should also return the string 'done' and have default values
