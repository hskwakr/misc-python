## Functions and methods provide useful tools

For words (i.e strings): Capitalize every letter or get the number of letters

For numbers (integers, floats): Create the absolute number, selected the larger of 2 numbers

Get input or pront output

## Functions

function_name('argument') -> value

## Exeercise

Create a Pythagoras theorem calculator

Once it is run, the code should ask the user for 2 numbers that are the width and height of a triangle

It should output the length of the hypotenuse

Difficulty: input always returns a string, even when a number was entered

Square root is equal to the power of 1/2
